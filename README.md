# [HABIT project](https://habit-project.herokuapp.com/)

The HABIT project is a web app allowing you to track habits every day on the web.
Want to start programming every single day? Workout 3 times a week? Or read one book a month? Then HABIT is for you.

Habit supports a colour mode, persistent saving of habits (and bringing them back, when they are due), editing and deleting your habits.

HABIT is a programming project originally developed as part of the course "web technologies" of HTW Berlins' Ba Sc. Business Computing. I'm using this project to train my basic programming skills and try out new things.
